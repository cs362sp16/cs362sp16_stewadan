Bug found for the council_room card.

The number of cards in player ones hand are not correct after playing the council room card. The player should draw 4 cards and discard the 
council_room card itself, giving them 5+4-1=8 cards, but they have 7 instead. 

The error is in the council_room function, it has the player draw cards in a for loop, but it only goes to i<3, it should be i<4.
