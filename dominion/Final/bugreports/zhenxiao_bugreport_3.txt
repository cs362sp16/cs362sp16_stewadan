Bug found for the village card.

The villager card is failing to perform both of its actions, as all of the unit tests for it fail. It should be giving the player 2 more actions
and drawing one card. Instead it gives one action and doesn't draw any cards.

The bug is in the fvillage function, all it does is increase actions by one and then discard the card, it needs to increase actions by 2
and also draw a card.
