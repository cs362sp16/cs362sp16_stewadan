Project 1 Changes - Refactoring 5 cards

The 5 cards i chose to refactor were the Smithy, the Village, the Outpost, the Great Hall
and the Salvager. I kept the calls within the switch statement, just because it seems like
later on this will be the best way to check to see which card is being used, simply using the case:card_name
and then calling the appropriate function. I moved all of the code for each card out of the switch statement 
and into their own functions. Each function is named card_name, where name is the name of the card.
Each function has to have the gamestate, currentPlayer and handPos as parameters, since they need to know
which player it is, which card to get rid of after it's used and they need to be able to update the gamestate.
The salvager also needs choice1 passed to it. I made each function an int that returns 0, so that it can simply 
make a call to the function in the return itself.
